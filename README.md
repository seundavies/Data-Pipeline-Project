# Data-Pipeline-Project

###A Data Pipeline Project involves designing and implementing a system that moves data from one or more sources to a destination, typically for analysis, reporting, and storage. This pipeline automates the process of data collection, transformation, and loading (ETL - Extract, Transform, Load), ensuring the data is clean, consistent, and accessible.
